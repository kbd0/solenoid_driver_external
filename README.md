# solenoid_driver_external

A daughterboard for toggling an externally powered solenoid via a 5V signal.  
Uses an optocoupler to isolate the signal-providing circuit from the solenoid circuit.  
  
I made this with the intention of using a USB arduino to control a 12V 3A solenoid powered by a 12V 3A AC adapter from aliexpress.  
  
Currently untested
